This is the Mobile App repository for the Onchain Investing project for BlockMagic 2024

Download the content from this repository, uncompress on your computer, then open the resulting folder in Android Studio.
Use the Run App icon at the top of the Android Studio window near the middle to get things initialized and to fire up the App.

Alternatively, you can use the zipped app-debug  component that contains the APK (Android Package Kit) file that you can use to install the App on your phone.


This App will display all new transactions created as our Onchain Investing smart contract receives USDT from an investor/user and swaps this USDT into the 
multiple assets that are included in the Model Portfolios we will be supporting.

You can emulate this app in Android Studio or run it on an Android device after you install the APK file.
